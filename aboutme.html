		<p><b> I'm Allison!</b>
		<p> I like hiking and travel, all kinds of music (movie/show soundtracks, orchestral, jazz, EDM, American and Korean pop, rock, indie, standards, etc.), meaningful song lyrics, puzzles of all kinds, learning languages (so far I have studied Spanish, Chinese, and Korean, and some Japanese), videogames, virtual reality, board/card games, violin, watercolor painting, seafood, puns, Harry Potter, interior design, and many different shows and movies (action, fantasy, crime dramas, etc.). </p>
		<p> Right now in my free time, I am trying to improve my watercolor and drawing skills.</p>
