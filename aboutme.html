		 <p><b> I'm Allison, a junior at UC Berkeley! </b> 

		 <p> I like hiking and travel, all kinds of music (movie/show soundtracks, orchestral, jazz, EDM, American and Korean pop, rock, indie, standards, etc.), meaningful song lyrics, puzzles of all kinds, learning languages (so far I have studied Spanish, Chinese, and Korean, and some Japanese), videogames, virtual reality, board/card games, violin, watercolor painting, seafood, puns, Harry Potter, interior design, and many different shows and movies (action, fantasy, crime dramas, etc.). </p>

		 <p> Right now in my free time, I am trying to improve my watercolor skills. I have also been recently introduced to Rubik's cubes and enjoy trying to improve my average solve time (as of now it is around 1 minute, 20 seconds so I have a long way to go!). I am watching the first season of Stranger Things, and the Marvel movies in chronological order (next up for me is Ant-Man). </p>
